# Knight's Duty
Knight's duty is a turn-based competitive free-for-all game for 2 to 6 players.

## Objective
The Goal of the game is to be the last man standing. 

You do that by attacking and hitting other players, while avoiding getting attacked and hit yourself.


## Components
+ Game Manual, 
+ Game Board,
+ 6 sets (1 for each player) of:
	- Equipment figures (1 Sword, 1 Spear, 1 Bow)
	- Action tokens (2 Sword, 2 Spear, 2 Bow, 2 Shield, 2 Parry, 3 Movement, 1 Inspiration)
	- Heart card
	- Knight figure
	- Battle cards (4 Hit, 4 Dodge, 2 Shield)

## Setup
Each player chooses a Clan and takes the set of tokens, cards and figure for that clan.

Then, starting from the most experienced player, every player chooses a spot on the board marked with **(P)** and puts his figure on top of it.

The adjacent spaces for tokens next to his starting position becames his knight's corner.

Each player then puts his Heart card face up next to the board, as well as his starting equipment

## The turns
Every turn, all the players pick actions fot the turn by putting their action tokens face down on their corner, being 3 actions if you have your Heart face up, or 2 actions if face down.

Every turn is comprised of 3 rounds, in which each player reveals his action for that round at the same time, starting on the action on the left of the corner, and resolve them.

### Resolving actions
Movement goes first, meaning that all the players that used the movement action simultaneously move their Knight 1 space in any direction.

Then players swap equipments, meaning that all players that used an action token for a equipment different that their current one, that player swaps the current equipment for the one just used.

Finally attacks resolve, meaning that all players that used an action token for their current equipment, they get to choose and oponent within range and attack him. 

All attacking players declare their targets within attack range, and resolve them in any order. If your target gets killed in that round, you may choose to target another opponent in range. If you don't have any target within attack range, you forfeit that action.

### Setting up combat
If a player is targeting a opponent within range, a combat occurs.

Each weapon has it's own range, being:
- Bow: 1 to 4 spaces
- Spear: 1 to 3 spaces
- Sword: 1 to 2 spaces

Then, the target adds cards to a pile depending of the weapon the attacker is using, being:
- Bow: 1 Hit and 3 Misses
- Spear: 2 Hits and 2 Misses
- Sword: 3 Hits and 1 Miss

If the attacker had inspiration, add 1 Hit card to the pile.
If the target has chosen the shield action this round, swap 1 Hit card from the pile for a Shield card.
If the target has chosen the parry action this round, if the attacker picks the Shield card, he imediatly unequips their weapon


### Resolving combat

To resolve the combat, the target shuffles the pile, and present it face down to the attacker, which draws one.

If the attacker draws a Hit, the attack was sucessful, otherwise it failed.

If the attack failed and the target has chosen the parry action this round, the attacker gets disarmed and unequips his weapon (Bows can't be disarmed), otherwise nothing happens.

If the attack was sucessful, the target is maimed, and flips his Heart face down. If he is already maimed (his Heart is face down already), he is critically wounded and is out of the game after the round is over.

Players that got critically wounded can still attack within the round, and are only out of the game after the round is over.

### The Glory Hill
The center of the board holds the Glory Hill space, marked with a **(\*)**.
The player standing on it is inspired.

## Winning
The last Knight standing is declared victorious. 
If two or more players fall in battle in the same round and no one is left standing, the match is a draw.
